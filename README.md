This is the decoder to an extremely simple encoding method that I made. The encryption method is also extremly simple. However, the details should remain hidden.


The decoder has a efficiency of **O(1)** since I used a dictionary (hash map). Therefore, decoding a message of **n** long will take **O(n)**, not O(n^2).
